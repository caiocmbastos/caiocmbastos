### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Caio and I'm from Brazil. I work as PHP developer for about a year and a half, about the same time that I graduated from college. I began to study Javascript earlier this year and recently started to learn React. Now I'm really passionate about this language and it's frameworks. I'm also passionate about databases, most with SQL like PostgreSQL and MySQL.

In my free time I like to read, most fantasy and science-fiction, to play (and watch) soccer, and to watch movies and series.
